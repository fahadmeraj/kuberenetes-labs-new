# by default it picks equal operator if we don't mention 1
# if leave effect empty "" then it will tolerate all 3 effects
# operater "Exists", then it will only check if mysize is there irrespective of its value
# if using taint, then taint every node otherwise there will be no guarantee that it will go the desired node
# if we leave key empty, along with exists operator then it can tolerate everything.
# if we leave effect empty, it will tolerate all of the effects
